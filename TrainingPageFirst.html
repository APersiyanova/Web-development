            I'll tell you about my favourite pink pencil. It has a delicate pink colour. It's lead is moderately soft. 
            It allows me to draw charming pink hearts on Valentine's Day postcards.

                My favourite pink pencil is comfartable to hold in hands. It's pleasant to touch.

            Sometimese if I occasionaly play to much and draw a princess on the wallpaper, it may not be as noticeable as if
            my favourite pencil would be like black colour. Or even a pen! A princess drawing on the wallpaper, made by a blue ballpoint
            pen... I think, it wouldn't have liked right away. Neither mom nor dad.
